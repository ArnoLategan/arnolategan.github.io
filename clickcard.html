My love for you will blossom until my dying days because I have felt purpose and I want to show you, love. While I might not have the most tantalizing words at my disposal to express my love to you, I will manage these three words (I love you) to let you know that my world revolves around you all year round. You know how I feel about you, I want you to also know that there is no mistaking in it. My love for you is real and I will love you forever because you are the only one that deserved to be loved this tenderly. Sometimes I get caught up with life issues and I start to worry, I get down and alone in thoughts, but the kind of love you give me just keeps me hanging on, all I will ever need is you, thank you for being there for me, love you so much. You mean the world to me, I say this from the bottom of my heart. You have proven to me that love doesn’t cost a thing, because I can’t possibly imagine what I could have done to deserve this kind of love, thank you for sharing part of your heart with me, I promise to handle and guide it with my life. I will love you forever and nothing can change that.';
